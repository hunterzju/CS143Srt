To wrap up and summarize our discussion of the global analysis of control flow graphs,
为了总结和总结我们对控制流图全局分析的讨论，

1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,050
we've talked about two kinds of analysis in the past several videos. Constant
在过去的几个视频中，我们已经谈到了两种分析。常量

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,190
propagation is what is called a forwards analysis Because information is pushed
传播是所谓的向前分析，因为信息被推送

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,910
from the inputs to the outputs. So if you think about a control flow graph. What
从输入到输出。所以如果你考虑一下控制流图。什么

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,440
happens in control flow analysis is that information flows in this direction.
在控制流分析中发生的情况是信息在这个方向上流动。

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,710
It flows in the same direction as computation. If I have a constant up here
它与计算方向相同。如果我这里有一个常量

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,780
x is assigned constant down here, and x is used later on and that constant will flow
x在这里被赋值为常量，稍后使用x，该常量将会流动。

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,019
forward to the uses. Okay So information flows in the same direction as computation.
展望未来的用途。好的，所以信息流动的方向和计算是一样的。

8
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:42,569
Liveness on the other hand is a backwards analysis. Information is pushed
另一方面，活跃度是一种逆向分析。推送信息

9
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:48,589
from outputs back towards inputs. So here in this example and let me change
从输出回到输入。所以在这个例子中，让我更改一下

10
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:55,589
colors. Here we see that x is live before the statement. And that liveness gets propagated
颜色。这里我们看到x在语句之前是活动的。这种活跃度就会被传播

11
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:59,709
in the other direction. It gets propagated against the control, against the
在另一个方向。它针对控件传播，针对

12
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:06,709
flow, of execution, backwards towards the beginning of the program.
执行流程，向后向程序开始的方向流动。

13
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,789
So they're many other kinds of global flow analysis in the literature. The
所以它们是文献中的许多其他类型的全球流动分析。这个

14
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:15,579
constant propagation analysis and the liveness analysis are two of the most important.
恒定传播分析和活性分析是其中最重要的两个。

15
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,049
There is a number of others that are also very important and many, many
还有一些其他的也非常重要，而且很多，很多

16
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,469
more that people have investigated. Almost all these analyses can be classified
更多的是人们已经调查过的。几乎所有这些分析都可以归类

17
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,950
as either forward or backward. There are some analyses and some important
不是向前就是向后。有一些分析和一些重要的

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,380
ones that are neither forward nor backward. That information is basically pushed
既不向前也不向后的。这些信息基本上是推送的

19
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,469
in both directions. And the other thing is that the, almost all the analyses
两个方向都有。另一件事是，几乎所有的分析

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,729
in the literature that do global flow analysis anyway also follow this methodology
无论如何，在进行全局流分析的文献中也遵循这种方法

21
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,619
of local Rules that relay information between adjacent program points.
在相邻节目点之间中继信息的本地规则。

22
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,780
So it, it's the local rules part that's important. So we break down the complicate
所以，当地的规定才是最重要的。所以我们把复杂的

23
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,219
d problem of analyzing an entire control flow graph into a collection
将整个控制流图分析为集合的三维问题

24
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,939
of rules that only do ver, propagate information very, very locally.
这些规则只会非常非常本地地传播信息。
