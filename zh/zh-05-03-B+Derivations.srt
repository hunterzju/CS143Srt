So to summarize, we're not just interested in whether a string is in
所以总而言之，我们不仅仅对字符串是否在

the language of a particular context-free grammar, we need to have a Parse Tree for
特定上下文无关文法的语言，我们需要有一个语法分析树

that string. And, a derivation defines a Parse Tree but it turns out that one Parse
那根绳子。而且，派生定义了一个解析树，但结果是一个解析

00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,509
Tree in general has many derivations and in particular, we're interested in the
树一般有许多派生，特别是，我们对

00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:24,919
leftmost and rightmost derivations. These are the two kinds of derivations that are
最左边和最右边的派生。这是两种派生，它们是

important in parser implementations.
在解析器实现中很重要。
