Well, we've come to the end of this video. And to summarize, we looked at regular
好了，我们已经到了这段视频的最后。总而言之，我们看了一下常规的

1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,400
expressions, which are used to define regular languages. And the regular
表达式，用于定义正则语言。还有普通的

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,910
expressions are syntax (that's the expression that we write down), and it
表达式是语法(这是我们写下的表达式)，它

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,660
denotes a set of strings which is the regular language and that's the meaning of
表示一组字符串，它是常规语言，这就是

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,870
the regular expression. And there are five kinds of regular expressions in the
正则表达式。中有五种正则表达式。

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,439
standard definition. There's an expression for the empty string and that's denoted by
标清。空字符串有一个表达式，由

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,289
epsilon and then we have all the one character strings and then there are three
Epsilon，然后我们有所有的一个字符串，然后还有三个

7
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:41,890
compound expressions - ways of building new regular expressions from other regular
复合表达式-从其他正则表达式构建新正则表达式的方法

8
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,460
expressions - and these are union, concatenation, and iteration.
