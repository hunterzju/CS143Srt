In this video, we're going to continue our discussion of the construction of
在这段视频中，我们将继续讨论

1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:14,100
[laugh](1) parsing tables by taking a look at how we build the follow sets. So here's
[笑](1)通过查看我们如何构建以下集合来解析表。所以这里是

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:21,860
the definition of follow of x, and recall that the follow set for a given symbol in
x的跟随的定义，并回想一下中给定符号的跟随集

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,439
the grammar isn't really about what that symbol can generate, really, doesn't
语法实际上不是关于符号可以生成什么，真的，不是

4
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,989
depend necessarily at all on what the symbol can generate. It depends on where
必须完全依赖于符号可以生成的内容。这取决于在哪里

5
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:34,570
that symbol can appear, where that symbol is used in the grammar. And we say that t
该符号可以出现，在语法中使用该符号。我们说t

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,760
is in the follow of x if there is some place in the grammar, some derivation,
在x后面，如果在语法中有某个位置，一些派生，

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,530
where that terminal t can appear immediately after the symbol x. Okay, so
其中终端T可以紧跟在符号x之后。好，所以

8
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:51,530
for all such. E. They make up the follow set of x. And here's some intuition about
为了所有这些。即它们组成了下面的x集合。这里有一些关于

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,069
how we would compute follow sets. Let's say we have a situation where X goes to
我们将如何计算跟随集。假设我们有这样一种情况，X去了

10
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:04,069
two symbols A, B, right? And then anything that B can produce in the first position
两个符号A，B，对吗？然后B在第一个位置能产生的任何东西

11
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,290
will clearly be in the follow of A. So if we have X goes to AB. And then through
很明显在A的后面，所以如果我们有X，就去AB。然后穿过

12
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,510
some more, steps, we can get something like, this A goes, B goes to T beta, then
更多的步骤，我们可以得到这样的结果，这个A是这样的，B是Tβ，然后是Tβ

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,960
we have a situation where the T comes immediately after the A, and so clearly,
我们有一种情况，T紧跟在A之后，所以很明显，

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,350
something that was in the first of B, is in the follow of A. So, so the basic rule
B的第一个部分，在A的后面，所以基本规则是

15
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,520
is that you have two symbols that are adjunct somewhere, the first of the second
你有两个符号在某个地方是附加的，第二个符号中的第一个

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,520
one is in the follow of the first one. Hm, now Another interesting effect here is
一个在第一个之后。嗯，现在另一个有趣的效果是

17
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,250
that, if we have, a symbol at the end of a production. Let's take a look at the B
那就是，如果我们有的话，在一部作品的结尾会有一个符号。我们来看一下B

18
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,640
here for a moment, okay? And a claim here that anything that's in the follow of the
在这里待一会儿，好吗？这里有一种说法，那就是紧随其后的任何东西

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,100
left hand side is gonna be in the follow of B. In this case, that the follow of X
左手边将在B的后面。在这种情况下，X的后面

20
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,110
is a subset of the follow of B. And let's take a look at that. Let's say that we
是B后面的子集，让我们来看看。比方说，我们

21
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,619
have, a situation where we have a derivation from the start symbol, okay? We
有一种情况，我们有一个从开始符号派生出来的情况，好吗？我们

22
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,700
wind up with X followed by T. It can, it can be other stuff around the [inaudible]
以X结尾，然后是T。它可以，它可以是[听不见]周围的其他东西

23
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,709
let's ignore that for the moment, let's just focus on the XT. Then we can use this
让我们暂时忽略这一点，让我们只关注XT。那我们就可以用这个

24
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:26,709
production X goes to AB and in one step we can get to ABT. And then we see T was in
生产X转到AB，我们只需一步就能到达ABT。然后我们看到T在

25
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,590
the follow of X a nd also, T is in the follow of B as a result, Okay. So,
跟在X后面的还有，T跟在B后面，好的。所以,

26
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,319
anything in the follow of X would also be in the follow of B. And we can generalize
任何跟在X后面的东西都会跟在B后面，我们可以推广

27
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,629
this observation about what occurs at the end of a production. So anything that
关于制作结束时发生的事情的观察。所以任何可以

28
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,849
occurs at the end of the production, it, its follow set will include the follow set
在生产结束时发生，它它的跟随集将包括以下集

29
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,810
of the symbol on the left hand side of the production. Well, what is the end of the
作品左手边的符号。那么，这场比赛的结局是什么呢？

30
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:56,749
production? If, if B can go to epsilon, if B can disappear, then A will appear at the
制作？如果，如果B可以去ε，如果B可以消失，那么A将出现在

31
00:02:56,749 --> 00:03:00,810
end of the production. Okay, so if B can go to epsilon, then it will also happen
制作结束了。好的，如果B可以去epsilon，那么它也会发生

32
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,019
that the follow of X, would be in the follow of A. And following up here in our
X的后边会是A的后边，在我们的

33
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,090
example, so we. Or up here we start with the start symbol. We got to XT. In one
举个例子，所以我们。或者在这里，我们从开始符号开始。我们到了XT。合二为一

34
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,469
step we got to ABT and so T was in the follow of B. But now, B can go into
我们到了ABT，所以T紧跟在B之后，但是现在，B可以进入

35
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:24,469
epsilon and so we can also get to AT and therefore T is also in the follow of A.
Epsilon，所以我们也可以得到AT，因此T也在A之后。

36
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,719
And finally there's one special case. Remember that we have our special symbol
最后还有一个特例。记住我们有我们的特殊标志

37
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:35,069
marking the end of the input, and what can that follow? Well the end of the input is
标记输入的结束，那么接下来会发生什么呢？好的，输入的末尾是

38
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,469
in the follow of the start symbol, alright? And this is just a way again of
在开始符号后面，好吗？这只是一种再一次

39
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,159
keeping track of what we're going to do when we run out of input. And we'll see
记录我们在输入耗尽时要做的事情。我们将拭目以待

40
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,099
how that's used when we built the parsing tables but we always add as an initial
我们在构建解析表时如何使用它，但我们总是将其作为首字母添加

41
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:56,099
condition, that dollar sign is in the follow of the start symbol. So now, let's
条件下，美元符号在开始符号后面。所以现在，让我们

42
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,599
take a look at and sketch of the algorithm for computing follows. So that's, as we
下面来看一下计算算法的草图。所以这就是，因为我们

43
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,939
just said, the dollar sign is in the follow of the start symbol. And now we
刚才说了，美元符号在开始符号后面。现在我们

44
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:13,609
take a look at each production. Okay, A goes to alpha X beta, we're, we're
看一看每一部作品。好的，A去阿尔法X贝塔，我们是，我们是

45
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,049
focusing here on the X. Okay, if we look at every production and we look at every
把焦点集中在X。好的，如果我们看每一部作品，我们看每一部

46
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:24,049
symbol on the right hand side of that production. And the first of beta, okay,
作品右手边的符号。第一个测试版，好的，

47
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,500
the thing that can follow x in this in this production, the first of that will be
在这部作品中，可以跟在x后面的是，第一个

48
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,199
in the follow of x, and also we just subtract out epsilon if it was in the
在x后面，如果ε在x后面，我们就减去ε

49
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,990
first sub-beta. We're not interested anymore in the epsilons for the purposes
第一次亚贝塔测试。我们对爱西隆不再感兴趣了

50
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,620
of follow sites, epsilon never appears in follow sites, so follow sites are always
在关注站点中，epsilon从未出现在关注站点中，因此关注站点总是

51
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,840
just sets of terminals. And now the second part of the algorithm is it if we have
只有几组终端。现在算法的第二部分是，如果我们有

52
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,150
some suffix of a production beta that can go to Epsilon, so Epsilon is in the first
生产测试版的一些后缀，可以到Epsilon，所以Epsilon是第一个

53
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,270
beta. Alright, this suffix of the production can completely disappear, then
贝塔。好的，那么制作的这个后缀就可以完全消失了。

54
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,409
as we saw on the previous slide the follow of left hand side symbol will be in the
正如我们在上一张幻灯片中看到的，下面的左侧符号将位于

55
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:12,409
follow of X. And that's it in terms of the rules for computing follow sets. So now
跟在X后面，这就是计算跟随集的规则。所以现在

56
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:18,750
let's work through an example. So here's our grammar again. And we're going to
让我们通过一个例子来了解一下。所以我们的语法又来了。我们要做的就是

57
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,379
compute, the follow sets for each of the symbols of the grammar. So let's begin,
计算语法中每个符号的以下集合。那么让我们开始吧，

58
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:30,009
with the, with the start symbol. We'll start with the follow of E. And by
带，带开始符号。我们将从E的后面开始，然后到

59
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:36,690
definition, we know that dollar is in the follow of E. So we get that one easily.
定义，我们知道美元跟在E后面，所以我们很容易得到它。

60
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,370
And now the question is what else could be in the follow of E, Alright? So in order
现在的问题是E后面还有什么，好吗？所以按照顺序

61
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,039
to figure that out we have to look at where E is used in the grammar, Alright?
要弄清楚这一点，我们必须看一下E在语法中的位置，好吗？

62
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,330
So remember always at follow sets are about where the symbol is used. Not what
所以请记住，始终在后面的集合是关于符号的使用位置。不是什么

63
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:58,330
it produces. Alright? So here. Is a place where E is used, and we can see that it is
它会产生。好吗？所以这里。是一个使用E的地方，我们可以看到它是

64
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,220
merely followed by a terminal symbol, so certainly close paren is in the follow of
后面只跟了一个终端符号，所以Close Paren肯定跟在

65
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,639
E, right? And there's one other place where E is used, and that's over here. And
E，对吗？还有一个地方用到了E，那就是这里。和

66
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,830
it appears that the right end of the production, and so then we know that
看起来是制作的正确结尾，所以我们知道

67
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,569
anything that's in the follow of X is also gonna be in the follow of E. And that's a
任何跟在X后面的东西都会跟在E后面，那就是a

68
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,289
constraint, and so we'll right that down over here 'coz this is just a property of
约束，所以我们会把它放在这里，因为这只是

69
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:29,199
the relationship. That the follow sets, will have when we're done computing them.
这段关系。当我们完成计算后，下面的集合就会有。

70
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,189
This doesn't immediately tell us anything new that's in the follow of E. But we know
这不会立即告诉我们跟在E后面的任何新情况，但我们知道

71
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:38,039
that as we go along, and we learn about things that are in the follow of X, we'll
在我们前进的过程中，我们了解了X后面的东西，我们将

72
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,849
have to add them to the follow of E. And let me just divide up. The slide here so
我要把它们加到E的后面，让我把它们分开。这里的幻灯片是这样的

73
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,310
we will put our properties that we know about relationships between fallocates
我们将把我们知道的关于错位之间关系的属性

74
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,099
over on the left hand side and we'll put the actual fallocates over here on the
在左手边，我们会把实际的错误放在这里

75
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:54,930
right side. So, now to make, that's the only two places, those are the only two pl
右边。所以，现在要做的是，这是唯一的两个地方，那是唯一的两个地方

76
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,659
aces where E is used in the grammar and to make further progress we need to know
E在语法中的用法是ACES，为了取得进一步的进步，我们需要知道

77
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,969
something about the follow of X. Okay, if we want to make further progress on the
关于X的后续内容。好的，如果我们想要在

78
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:07,219
follow of E then we need to figure out what's in the follow of X. So, let's focus
跟在E后面，然后我们需要弄清楚跟在X后面的是什么。所以，让我们集中注意力

79
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:11,280
on that for a minute. So, where's X used in the grammar, well it's used in only one
想一想这件事。那么，X在语法中的用法是什么，它只用在一个

80
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,099
place and that's here, Okay? Where it appears at the right end of a production.
就在这里，好吗？它出现在一部作品的右端。

81
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:21,449
And what, and so therefore, the symbol on the left hand side will be a subset of the
因此，左手边的符号将是

82
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:28,449
follow set of X. So we're gonna know that the follow of E is a subset of the follow
跟随X的集合。所以我们将知道E的跟随是下面的子集

83
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:36,099
of X. Alright? And what does that mean? Well, so follow of X is a subset of follow
关于X的，好吗？那是什么意思？那么，X的Follow是Follow的子集

84
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,090
of E. And follow of E is a subset of the follow of X. So that really means that
E的后跟是X的后跟的子集，所以这实际上意味着

85
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,830
these two sets are equal. The follow of X and the follow of E, whatever they wind up
这两套是相等的。X跟在后面，E跟在后面，不管它们以什么结尾

86
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,099
being, are gonna have to be the same set. And now we've looked at all the places
必须是同一套。现在我们已经看过了所有的地方

87
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,349
where E is used in the grammar. We've looked at all the places where X is used
其中E用在语法中。我们看过所有使用X的地方

88
00:07:54,349 --> 00:08:00,509
in the grammar. We can't learn anything more about what is in the sets, the follow
在语法上。我们不能更多地了解布景里有什么，下面是

89
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,749
sets of E and X. We're not forced to add anything else, to either set, and so we're
E和X的集合。我们没有被强迫添加任何其他的东西，对这两个集合中的任何一个，所以我们

90
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:10,599
done. And so we can close off this set. And we know the follow of E consists of
好了。这样我们就可以关闭这个布景了。我们知道E的后面是由

91
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:17,599
dollar sign and closed paren. And we also know that X. Has the same set, the same
美元符号和闭合的帕伦。我们也知道X有相同的集合，相同的集合

92
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,319
follow set. Alright, so now let's move on to the follow of T, All right. So what's
跟随SET。好的，现在让我们继续T的后面，好的。那么什么是

93
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,140
going to be in the follow of T? Well we, again we have to look at where T is used
会追随T的脚步吗？那么我们，我们还是要看看T在哪里用的

94
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,219
in the grammar. So T is used in two places. The first one is here in the first
在语法上。所以T用在两个地方。第一个在这里，在第一个

95
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,849
production. And so what's going to be in the follow of T? Well it could be anything
制作。那么T之后会是什么呢？嗯，它可以是任何东西。

96
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:49,240
that is in the first of X. Okay? Cuz X comes immediately after T. And if you
那是在X的第一个，好吗？因为X紧跟在T之后，如果你

97
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,320
recall from the previous video, there were only two things in the first of X. One was
回想上一段视频，X的第一部分只有两样东西，一是

98
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,870
plus. So this plus is definitely in the follow of T and let's just review. [cough]
另外。所以这个加号肯定在T后面，我们来复习一下。[咳嗽]

99
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,870
Excuse me. How that can happen, so we can go from E. To TX, okay? I'm using the
打扰了。怎么会这样，这样我们就可以从东部到德克萨斯州了，好吗？我正在使用

100
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,730
first production. And now we see the X comes after the T. And then in one more
第一部作品。现在我们看到X在T之后，然后再加一个

101
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,070
step, we can go to T plus E. And now we have a derivation where plus follows T.
我们可以转到T+E，现在我们有一个导数，其中+跟在T后面。

102
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,320
And that's how we, that's, that's Y pluses in the follow of T. Alright? So the other
这就是我们，也就是T后面的Y加号，好吗？所以另一个

103
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,589
thing that was in the first of X was epsilon, because there's an epsilon
X的第一个部分是ε，因为有一个epsilon

104
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:32,040
production for X over here. But remember that we're not interested in, we don't
在这里为X制作。但请记住，我们对此不感兴趣，我们不会

105
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,709
include epsilon in follow sets. And so X doesn't contribute anything else, to the,
将epsilon包括在以下集合中。所以X没有贡献任何其他的东西，

106
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:43,850
to the follow of T. But since X can go to epsilon, remember what that means. That
跟在T后面，但既然X可以到ε，记住这是什么意思。那

107
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,870
means that over here, looking back at this first use of T again in the grammar, this
意思是，在这里，再回顾一下T在语法中的第一次使用，这

108
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:54,079
X can disappear. Right and that means that anything it is in the follow of E is also
X可以消失。对，这意味着它跟在E后面的任何东西也是

109
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:59,399
in the follow of T. Now we already know the follow of E. So we can just add those
现在我们已经知道了E的后缀，所以我们只需添加这些

110
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,089
things in. Okay? And let me write that down over here, just so that we don't
东西都进来了。好吧?让我把它写在这里，这样我们就不会

111
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:09,579
forget it. So, to follow. Of, of E is a subset of the follow of T. We won't really
休想。所以，接下来。of，of E是T后面的一个子集。我们不会真的

112
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:15,320
need this fact again but, useful to write it down, perhaps. Alright and now we are
我需要再次了解这个事实，但是，也许把它写下来会很有用。好的，现在我们是

113
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,130
done with this use of x. We've included everything implied by this production that
已经完成了x的这个用法。我们已经包含了这个结果所暗示的所有

114
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,360
we can in the follow of T and so now have to look at the other place where T is used
我们可以跟在T后面，所以现在必须看一下使用T的另一个地方

115
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,899
and that's over here. Okay, and so here we're going to see that T is in the right
那就是这里。好的，这里我们将看到T是正确的

116
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,600
end of a production, so anything that is in the follow Y can also be in the follow
产品的结束，所以后面的Y中的任何东西也可以在下面

117
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,600
of T, alright? So the follow of Y. Is going to be a subset of the follow of T,
关于T的，好吗？所以Y的后跟将是T的后跟的子集，

118
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,440
alright. So now we can go off and work on the follow of Y. We have to in order to
好的。所以现在我们可以出发去做Y的后续工作了。我们必须这样做，以便

119
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,760
figure out what the follow of T is going to be, we're gonna have to know the follow
算出后面的T是什么，我们必须知道下面的

120
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,620
of Y. So where is Y used in the grammar? Well there is only one place and that's
那么Y在语法中用在哪里呢？嗯，只有一个地方，那就是

121
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,680
over here. And also Y appears in the right hand of production which means that the
在这里。Y也出现在产品的右手边，这意味着

122
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,310
left hand side symbol it's follow set will be included in the follow of Y. >> And so
左手边符号它的跟随集将包含在Y>>的后面，依此类推

123
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:16,310
the follow of t will be a subset of the follow of y. All right? And now again, we
t后面的是y后面的子集，好吗？现在又一次，我们

124
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,570
have two follow sets that are subsets of each other. Follow of y is a subset of
有两个相互为子集的跟随集。跟在y后面的是的子集

125
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,480
follow of t, and follow of t is a subset of follow of y. And so these two sets, we
跟在t后面，跟在t后面是跟在y后面的子集，所以这两个集合，我们

126
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,480
know are going to have to be equal. Okay? So we can write down here. At the follow
必须是相等的。好吧?这样我们就可以在这里写下来了。在以下位置

127
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:40,079
of Y, includes plus, dollar, enclose parette. Just like the follow of T. And
的，包括加号、美元、包含Parette。就像T和

128
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,019
now we're done. We've, we've, follow of T, and follow of Y. We've followed all the
现在我们做完了。我们，我们跟着T，跟着Y。我们跟着所有的

129
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,360
implications of, how the follow of T gets things into, what can be included in the
的含义，下面的T是如何把东西放进去的，什么可以包含在

130
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,100
follow of T. We've worked out all the places where Y is used in the grammar, and
跟在T后面。我们已经算出了Y在语法中用的所有地方，还有

131
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,779
added all the things that we can, based on, it's context. And there's nothing more
根据它的背景，添加了我们能做的所有事情。没有什么比这更多了

132
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,649
that we're forced to add either said. So we can go ahead and close these sets off.
我们不得不加上这两个词中的任何一个。这样我们就可以继续关闭这些布景了。

133
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:15,649
They're finished, Alright. So now We've done the follow of E, X, T, and Y. So
他们做完了，好的。现在我们已经完成了E、X、T和Y的操作。

134
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,740
we've taken care of all the terminal symbols. But, I'm sorry, All the
我们已经处理了所有的终端符号。但是，我很抱歉，所有的

135
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,730
non-terminal symbols. But we still need to compute the follow sets for the terminal
非端子符号。但是我们仍然需要为终端计算以下集合

136
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,440
symbols. And unlike the case with first sets, the follow sets for terminal symbols
符号。与第一个集合的情况不同，端子符号的以下集合

137
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,940
can actually be interesting. So let's take a look, at the follow of open paren. Okay,
可能真的会很有趣。那么让我们来看一看，下面是开放的帕伦。好吧,

138
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,529
what can follow an open paren in a derivation? Well open paren is only used
派生中可以跟随开放Paren的是什么？嗯，敞开的帕伦只用来

139
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:44,670
in one places. It's here. Okay. And so, what can follow in open parens is whatever
在一个地方。就在这里。好吧。因此，左括号中可以跟的内容是

140
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:51,170
is in the first of E. And remember that the first of E, was the same as the first
是在E的第一个，记住E的第一个和第一个是一样的

141
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,920
of T, because T always produces something in the first position. And the first of T
因为T总是在第一个位置产生一些东西。和T的第一个

142
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,720
was what? It was open paren. An int, 'kay? And if you think about this for a minute,
是什么？是敞开的，帕伦。一个整数，好吗？如果你想一分钟，

143
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,149
this makes complete sense. What can come after an at any valid, at any valid string
这完全有道理。在任何有效的、任何有效的字符串的at后面可以出现什么

144
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,579
in this grammar, while it's going to be another nested parenthize expression, or
在此语法中，虽然它将是另一个嵌套的括号表达式，或者

145
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:16,389
is it going to be an integer. In particular, you couldn't have a times or a
它会是一个整数吗。尤其是，你不能有一次或一次

146
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,889
plus immediately after an and you couldn't absolutely have the end of the input, you
加上紧接在输入之后，您不能绝对结束输入，您可以

147
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,660
couldn't have the input stop after an and have a valid string. So now let's take a
不能让输入在后停止，并且具有有效字符串。所以现在让我们来看一看

148
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:32,660
look at the follow of. Okay? So what's in that set? Again, we look at where the
请看下面的……好吧?那套里面有什么？再一次，我们来看一下

149
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,269
symbol is used. It's only used here, in this one production. So and, because it
使用符号。它只在这里使用，在这一部作品中使用。所以，因为它

150
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:41,050
appears at the right end of the production, we know that whatever is in
出现在制作的正确末端，我们知道无论里面是什么

151
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,910
the follow of T is going to be in the follow of ), all right. And so what was in
T的后面是)，好的。那么里面有什么呢？

152
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,910
the follow of T, [cough], that was +$), Okay. So, now let's move on and take a
<foreign language=“English”>T</foreign>后面，[咳]，就是+$)，好的。那么，现在让我们继续，让我们来看一看

153
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:04,779
look at the operators. Let's look at the follow of plus. So where's plus used?
看看操作员。让我们看看下面的加号。那么PLUS在哪里用呢？

154
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,779
Well, it's only used here. So whatever's in the first of E is going to be in the
嗯，它只在这里用。所以无论E的第一个字母是什么，都会出现在字母E的第一个字母中

155
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:16,069
follow of plus. And we already know what the first of E was. That was an open
跟在加号后面。我们已经知道E的第一个是什么了。那是一个空档

156
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:23,069
[inaudible], An int, Okay. And remember also that E cannot go to Epsilon. So, E
[听不见]，一个整数，好的。还要记住E不能去Epsilon。所以，E

157
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:29,120
cannot ever disappear completely because T always produces at least one terminal.
不可能完全消失，因为T总是至少产生一个终端。

158
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,139
Therefore, only the things that are in the first of year in the follow of plus.
因此，只有在第一年的事情是在加号之后。

159
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,170
Because E can't go to Epsilon, we only have to include the things that are in the
因为E不能去Epsilon，我们只需要包括在

160
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,690
first of E, in the follow of plus. Again, if you think about it for a minute this
第一个是E，后面是加号。再说一次，如果你想一分钟，这是

161
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,829
makes complete sense. What could come after a plus? Well, it could be an
完全有道理。加了之后会发生什么呢？嗯，这可能是一个

162
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:50,470
integer, the second argument to an addition, or it could be the beginning of
整数，加法的第二个参数，也可以是

163
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,370
another nested expression. And it couldn't be a times. It certainly couldn't be the
另一个嵌套表达式。它不可能是一个时代。当然不可能是

164
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:02,329
end of the input cuz you always have to have an argument after the plus. And, >>
输入的末尾，因为你总是必须在加号后面有一个参数。并且，>>

165
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:09,329
And I think that's it. I think that's all the other possibilities. >> Okay, Alright.
我想就是这样了。我想这就是所有其他的可能性了。>>好的，好的。

166
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:16,790
Now let's take a look at the follow of times. What can come after a times. Where
下面我们来看一下时间。一段时间后会发生什么。哪里

167
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,100
is times used, it's used here. So things that are in the first of t. Are gonna be
用的是时间，这里用的是时间。所以第一部分的内容将会是

168
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,519
in the follow of times again, alright? [inaudible] we already know what that is.
在接下来的时间里再来一次，好吗？[听不见]我们已经知道那是什么了。

169
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,839
That's the same as the first of E. That's open paren and ints. And again, this makes
这与E的第一个相同，也就是开放的Paren和INT。再一次，这使得

170
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,110
complete sense. What can come after a times? It's either the beginning of
完全有意义。一次之后会发生什么呢？要么就是这场战争的开始

171
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,209
another [inaudible] expression or an integer. It's certainly not a plus or the
另一个[听不见的]表达式或整数。这肯定不是一个好消息，也不是一个好消息。

172
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:39,329
end of the input, okay? And again, T cannot go to epsilon, and so that's the
输入结束，好吗？再说一次，T不能去ε，所以这就是

173
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,810
only thing. Those are the only things that can be in the follow of times. And now we
只有一件事。这些是唯一可以在接下来的时代中出现的东西。现在我们

174
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:50,790
just have one more symbol to go. We have to look at the follow of an integer, of an
只剩下一个标志了。我们必须看一个整数的后面，一个

175
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,660
int. Okay, where is that used in the grammar? Well, it's right here, Alright.
内部好的，这句话在语法中用在哪里？嗯，就在这里，好的。

176
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,410
So the, what's gonna be in the follow [inaudible], what 's going to include
那么，接下来(听不见)会有什么，会包括什么呢？

177
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,699
everything in the first of Y. Okay. What's in the first of Y, well times was in the
一切都在Y的第一个。好的。Y的第一个字母是什么，时间在字母Y的第一个字母中

178
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,370
first of Y, and epsilon was in the first of Y but remember, we don't include
在Y的第一个，ε在Y的第一个，但是记住，我们不包括

179
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:16,199
epsilons in follow sets. So, Y contributes times to the follow of int. But now,
下面几组中的爱普西隆。所以，Y为int的后面贡献了时间。但现在，

180
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,350
because Y could go to the epsilon and epsilon could [inaudible], that means that
因为Y可以到达epsilon，而epsilon可以[听不见]，这意味着

181
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,980
this int could wind up being at the right end of this production. Okay, it could,
这个int可能最终会成为这部作品的正确结局。好吧，有可能，

182
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,610
the Y could disappear and then whatever could follow the T could also follow the
Y可以消失，然后T后面的任何东西也可以跟着

183
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,699
int. Right, so we have to include the things in the follow of T. In the follow
内部对，所以我们必须把T后面的东西包括在后面

184
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:41,839
of it, and what was in the follow of T where that was a plus. It was a dollar.
以及紧随其后的是什么，这是一个加号。是一美元。

185
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,100
And it was a close paren, okay? And what does that tell us? Well it tells us, okay
这是一个势均力敌的朋友，好吗？这说明了什么呢？它告诉我们，好吗？

186
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,490
for most anything to follow an int but as an open paren cannot follow an int. So you
对于大多数跟在int后面的东西来说，除了作为一个开放的Paren之外，它不能跟在int后面。所以你

187
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,690
can't have another nesit expression with a, begin right after an int without an
不能有另一个带有a的嵌套表达式，在没有a的int之后立即开始

188
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:01,779
intervening operator, Alright? And that completes the computation of the follow
介入操作员，好吗？这就完成了下面的计算

189
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,040
sets for this example.
为本例设置。
